A simple blog application written on Django.

It has no complicated features, just only texting and commenting.

Project was written as the final exam work after my employer's internal Django education. It represents different aspects of working with models and views. Some HTML in templates and css are also present.

Blog was inspirated by Mozilla's developers documents site with DIY project for their Django tutorial. Although my project is not really the same thing, they are pretty close enough.
